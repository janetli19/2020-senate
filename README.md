# Predicting the 2020 U.S. Senate Election
### AC 209A: Data Science 1 Final Project

I used demographic, economic, voter turnout, and candidate incumbency data to predict the winning candidate in each 2020 Senate race. After comparing logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and decision tree models, with and without regularization and polynomial features, the final model (logistic regression with Lasso regularization) predicted the results of the 2020 Senate election with 95.38% accuracy.
